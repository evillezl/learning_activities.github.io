        <h1>Personal Website</h1>
        <a href="https://evillezl.github.io/"><img src="images/elsy_website.png" alt="elsy's website"></a> 
        <p><b>Course:</b> WEB 1400</p>
        <p>In this activity, we have applied what I have learned so far from HTML and CSS and created my own personal website.</p>
        <ol class="challenge">
            <li><b>What was challenging?</b></li>
            <ol>
                <li>The challenging part was CSS. The upside, was that the website was based on my resume. So I already had the content available.
                However, since, this was my first challenge. I didn't know what rules apply to what page, to make it readable. 
                Especially, since my home page is the first impression of me. 
                I decided to go with the colors pink and green, based on colors of the red rocks that we have in Utah.</li>

        <h1>Ivan's Ice-Scream and Snowies</h1>
        <a href="https://evillezl.github.io/IvansIcecreamandSnowies.github.io/"><img src="images/Ivans_icecream.png" alt="website of Ivan's Ice-Cream and Snowies Resturant"></a>
        <p><b>Course:</b> WEB 1400</p>
        <p>In this activity, we have applied what I have learned so far from HTML and CSS and created a website for the resturant.</p>
        <ol class="challenge">
            <li><b>What was challenging?</b></li>
            <ol>
                <li>The challenging part was color matching the website. It was difficult, because I wanted it to be the similar colors of the resturant and include Ice-Cream graphics.</li>
            </ol>
