Personal Website
link: https://evillezl.github.io/ 
Course: WEB 1400
In this activity, we have applied what I have learned so far from HTML and CSS and created my own personal website.
What was challenging?
    The challenging part was CSS. The upside, was that the website was based on my resume. So I already had the content available.
    However, since, this was my first challenge. I didn't know what rules apply to what page, to make it readable. Especially, since my home page is the first impression of me. 
    I decided to go with the colors pink and green, based on colors of the red rocks that we have in Utah. 
Ivan's Ice-Scream and Snowies
link: https://evillezl.github.io/IvansIcecreamandSnowies.github.io/
Course: WEB 1400
In this activity, we have applied what I have learned so far from HTML and CSS and created a website for the resturant.
What was challenging?
    The challenging part was color matching the website. It was difficult, because I wanted it to be the similar colors of the resturant and include Ice-Cream graphics.
